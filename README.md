# IOT Based Water Quality Monitoring System (Arduino)
This project demonstrates an IoT-based Water Quality Monitoring System using Arduino, which continuously measures key water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, turbidity, and TDS (Total Dissolved Solids). The system transmits real-time data to a cloud platform, enabling remote monitoring and ensuring safe and clean water.

Features
✔ Real-time water quality monitoring using multiple sensors.
✔ IoT-enabled: Data can be sent to a cloud server for remote access.
✔ Low-cost implementation using easily available sensors and components.
✔ Customizable and expandable with additional sensors for more parameters.

Components Used
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
pH Sensor (for measuring water acidity/alkalinity)
Turbidity Sensor (to check water clarity)
TDS Sensor (to measure dissolved solids in water)
Temperature Sensor (DS18B20) (to monitor water temperature)
Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/NodeMCU) (for IoT connectivity)
LCD Display (optional) (for local display of readings)
Jumper Wires
Breadboard
Power Supply (USB/Battery)
How It Works
Data Collection:

The sensors collect pH, turbidity, TDS, and temperature data from the water source.
Data Processing:

The Arduino processes the sensor readings and formats the data.
IoT Connectivity:

The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module transmits the data to an IoT cloud platform (e.g., ThingSpeak, Blynk, or Firebase) for remote monitoring.
Display and Alerts:

The data is displayed on an LCD screen (optional).
If any parameter exceeds the safe threshold, the system can trigger an alert or send a notification.
